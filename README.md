This app is a pong clone which was built to generate pixel data to feed into a machine learning algorithm (Reinforcement Learning).
I wrote the code at GrizzHacks 2017 which is a hackathon in Michigan USA, it was quite a lot of fun.


To play just

python pong.py

or

python3.5 pong.py


Use the left and right arrow keys to move your paddle. Have fun :)
